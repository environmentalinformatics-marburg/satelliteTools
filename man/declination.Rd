\title{Compute declination angle}
\usage{
declination(n, formula = c("Cooper", "Spencer"), unit = c("radians",
  "degrees"))
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Day of the year (DOY) as \code{integer} or \code{Date} from which to
derive DOY.}

\item{formula}{\code{character}, formula from which to calculate the angular 
declination of the sun, specified through the name of the author (see 
References). Currently, the approximation equation from Cooper (1969) and the 
more accurate version from Spencer (1971) are available.}

\item{unit}{\code{character}, determines whether to return the declination 
angle in radians (default) or degrees.}
}
\value{
A \code{numeric} declination angle.
}
\description{
Compute the declination of the sun at solar noon based on the day of the 
year.
}

"The declination of the sun is the angle between the equator and a line drawn 
from the centre of the Earth to the centre of the sun." (directly taken from

\examples{
## calculate current declination angles
sapply(c("Cooper", "Spencer"), function(frml) {
  declination(Sys.Date(), formula = frml)
